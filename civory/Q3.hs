-- For each named expression replace "undefined"

-- with an expression with the same type as the declaration

-- Note where the answer is a list, you will not get marks for giving an empty list as an answer, 

-- even though it is syntactically correct. (Nice idea, though!)



j1:: (String,Integer)

j1 = ("Hello", 1)

-- possible answer here would be 

-- j1 = ("Me", 1)



j2:: [Integer]

j2 =  [1,2,3]



j3:: (String, [Integer])

j3 =  ("Hello",[1,2,3])





j4:: [[Integer]]

j4 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]





j5:: (Integer,[Bool],Char)

j5 =  (3, [True, False], 'a')



j6:: (Integer,(String,Integer, String))

j6 = (1, ("Hello", 2, "Greetings"))



j7:: [(Integer, String)]

j7 =  [(1, "Hello"), (2, "Greetings")]



j8:: [[(Integer,Bool)]]

j8 = [[(1,True), (2, False)], [(3,True), (4, False)]]
